    "1. Prepare Inputs:\n",
    "   - Sample a batch of real images and their labels from the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Generate Fake Images:\n",
    "   - Pass the noise and labels to the generator.\n",

    "3. Critic Evaluation:\n",
    "   - Pass both:\n",
    "     - Real images concatenated with their labels.\n",
    "     - Fake images concatenated with their labels.\n",
    "   - The critic outputs scores indicating how real the images are and whether they match the labels.\n",

    "   - Compute the critic's loss, which:\n",
    "     - Encourages high scores for real images with correct labels.\n",
    "     - Assigns low scores to fake images or real images with mismatched labels.\n",
    "   - This helps the critic learn to detect label-image mismatches early in training when the generator's outputs are poor.\n",

    "## Sampling\n",

Higher value of $d$ means a larger area of the distribution is covered, making the samples to have higher diversity but lower fidelity. Lower value of $d$ means a smaller area of the distribution is covered, making the samples to have lower diversity but higher fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the FID may not works well with the truncation trick since FID requires the sample to have both high diversity and fidelity, but the truncation trick focus more on one of those aspect. Therefore, the method of evaluation highly depends on the application of the model, and human evaluation is also an crucial part\n",

    "## Precision and recall for GAN\n",

    "# StyleGANs\n",
    "GANs have improved in\n",
    "1. Stability: longer, more stable training that can generate better results\n",
    "2. Capacity: increasing model size and generating high resolution images\n",
    "3. Diversity: increasing variety of the generated images\n",
    "\n",
    "StyleGAN is a state-of-the-art GAN that achieves high fidelity (resolution), high diversity, and have more control over detailed image features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of StyleGAN includes:\n",
    "1. Progressive growing\n",
    "2. Noise mapping network\n",
    "3. Adaptive instance normalization (AdalN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progressive growing\n",
    "A common issue of traditional GANs is the output image size are often very small to ensures training stability (eg. 64x64). Generating high resolution images is challenging because the generator must learn how to output both large structure and fine details at the same time; having wrong details can make the generated images to be easily classified as fake. Also, training for generating high resolution images require significantly more memory and time\n",
    "\n",
    "Progressive growing is a solution that helps the generator to have stable training when generating high resolution images. It involves starting with a very small image and incrementally adding blocks of layers that increase the output size of the generator model and the input size of the discriminator model to increase resolution. This incremental nature allows the training to first discover large-scale structure of the image distribution and then shift attention to increasingly finer scale detail, instead of having to learn all scales simultaneously.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334404121/figure/fig2/AS:779799152844802@1562930014736/Details-of-the-architecture-of-the-progressive-growing-network-According-to-the-training.png\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of suddenly insert new layers to the networks, we fade them in gradually using a blending factor $\\alpha$ to prevent sudden shocks to the already well-trained, smaller-resolution layers. Also, all layers remain trainable during the training process, including existing layers when new layers are added\n",

    "### Growing the Generator\n",
    "When inserting a new layer to the generator, we need 2 layers in parallel, an upsampling layer, which simply upsamples the image size by 2 without any learnable parameters, and an normal convolutional block that doubles the output image size, which contains both conv and activations layer inside. Essentially, both layers will have the same output dimension, which doubles the image sizes from the previous layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from the upsampling layer and convolutional block is combined using a **blending factor** $\\alpha$, which transitions smoothly from 0 to 1 over time. This blending process ensures a gradual shift in the generator's behavior, preventing destabilization during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from these layers is combined using a blending factor, $\\alpha$, which gradually increases from 0 to 1 over time. This blending process is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output} = (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{Upsampling Output} + \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Conv Block Output}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initially, $\\alpha = 0$, so the output depends entirely on the upsampling layer.\n",
    "* As $\\alpha$ gradually increases, the contribution of the convolutional block grows while the upsampling layerâ€™s influence diminishes.\n",
    "* When $\\alpha = 1$, the output depends entirely on the convolutional block.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gradual transition minimizes the risk of sudden shifts in the learned distributions when a new layer is added to ensure stable training. Once the blending process for one resolution is complete (when $\\alpha = 1$), the next layer can be added to further increase the image resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growing the Discriminator\n",
    "Similar to growing the generator, the discriminator is grown by having 2 layers in parallel, an downsampling layer or pooling layer, which downsamples the image size by 2 without any learnable parameters, and a normal convolution block. Again, both layers will have the same output dimensions, which reduces the input image size by 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is also blended with the blending factor $\\alpha$, following the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output} = (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{Downsampling Output} + \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Conv Block Output}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\alpha$ increases from 0 to 1, the output gradually transitions the conv block output, which ensures a smooth transition\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator and discriminator grow symetrically, which means whenever a new layer is inserted into the generator, a new layer will be inserted into the discriminator too. However, the blending factor is not shared between generator and the discriminator, so they control the blending process independently. This is because sharing $\\alpha$ could lead to instability. In general, the generator might need a longer blending period to adapt to a new resolution, while the discriminator might adapt more quickly. By keeping $\\alpha$ separate, each model can transition at its own pace, and grow together until both models are ready"
