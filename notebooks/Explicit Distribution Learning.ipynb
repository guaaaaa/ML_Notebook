    "# The Data Generation Problem\n",
    "Data comes in many modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. We denote a generic data sample by the mathematical object $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Space\n",
    "A data sample $x$ belongs to a known data space, denoted as $\\mathcal{X}$ (i.e., $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$). Essentially, the data space is defined as a high dimensional space that contains all possible value combinations of the raw data representation. However, not all points within this high-dimensional space represent valid or meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider a dataset of $5 \\times 5$ black & white images of digits. If each pixel can take a binary value $\\{0, 1\\}$, the data space is $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}^{5 \\times 5}$. This space contains $2^{25}$ possible combinations. However, the vast majority of these points look like random noise; only a tiny subset actually forms coherent, recognizable digits, which are what we considered as valid data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Distribution\n",
    "The data distribution, denoted as $p(x)$, describes the probability of observing a specific sample $x$ from the space $\\mathcal{X}$. This distribution is the key to differentiating meaningful data from noise in the data space\n",
    "* Valid/Meaningful samples are assigned high probability.\n",
    "* Invalid samples are assigned a probability near or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, $p(x)$ mathematically represents the hidden patterns and structure governing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "A dataset is a finite collection of samples $\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$ that have been drawn (sampled) from the underlying data distribution $p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data spaces are typically high-dimensional and mathematically intractable. It is impossible to capture or enumerate every point in the space because the volume is too vast. However, valid data usually occupies a very small, concentrated region within this vast space (often referred to as a \"manifold\"). By modeling the data distribution $p(x)$, we can focus purely on these high-probability regions and ignore the massive regions of the data space that contain invalid noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of Generation\n",
    "In generative modeling, the goal is to learn a target data distribution $p(x)$, either explicitly (learning the density function) or implicitly (learning a mechanism to generate samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to construct a model that, after observing a limited training dataset, learns to sample new, unique data points that look as if they were drawn from the original distribution $p(x)$, although the original distribution is unknown."

    "For supervised learning tasks with data $(x, y)$, a discriminative model learns to directly estimate the conditional probability $P(y|x)$. This approach learns a decision boundary between different data points, which is effectively a direct mapping from an input to an output. Because they focus solely on the boundary, discriminative models do not explicitly model the underlying distribution of the input data, meaning they simply learn how to separate classes to minimize the loss but do not understand what the data actually looks like.\n",

    "### Generative Models\n",
    "A generative model aims to learn the complete data distribution. For a dataset without labels, it learns the distribution $P(x)$, and for a labelled dataset, it learns the joint distribution $P(x, y)$. This is often understood through the factorization $P(x|y)P(y)$, meaning the model learns \"what the data looks like\" (the likelihood $P(x|y)$) given a specific label.\n",

    "1.  **Sparsity of Observations:** Out of all possible configurations in the high-dimensional space, our collected samples $\\mathcal{D}$ represent the \"realized\" events. Because these specific points were observed, they must have a high density under the true probability distribution $P_{data}$.\n",
    "2.  **The Optimization Goal:** We want our model $P_{\\theta}$ to mimic this true distribution.
