    "# Reinforcement learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a framework in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment in order to maximize cumulative reward. The agent observes the current state, selects an action, receives a reward, and transitions to a new state. Over time, it learns a policy that maximizes long-term returns through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "**Agent**: the entity that makes decisions, performs actions in the environment, receives rewards, and learns from the consequences of its actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment**: everything external to the agent that it can interact with\n",
    "\n",
    "**State ($s$)**: all the information needed to describe the current situation of the environment. The agent will take action based on the current state, and an agent action (most of the time) will cause the transition to a new state. A state should be Markovian\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action ($a$)**: the decision taken by the agent after assessing the current state that can affect the environment. An action can be either discrete or continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward ($r$)**: a feedback given to an agent after it performs an action. The reward can be positive or negative based on the action taken and the resulting state, which tells the agent how good or bad its action was. A reward can be immediate or delayed. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward. The reward signal is the way of communicating to the agent what we want achieved, not how we want it achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discount factor ($\\gamma$)**: a number between 0 and 1 that balances the future reward value based on the number of actions required. The more actions required, the smaller the rewards will be. Larger $\\gamma$ means the algorithm is patient and will look for long term reward, where smaller $\\gamma$ means the algorithm is impatient and will look for short term reward. The discount factor ensures the reward convergence in infinite horizon problems \n",
    "\n",
    "**Return ($G_t$)**: the total accumulated reward with discount after a timestep $t$, where\n",
    "$$G_t= r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \\gamma^{n-1} r_{t+n},$$\n",
    "where $r_{t+1}$ represents the reward after $t$th action is taken followed by $n$ total actions afterward\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy ($\\pi(s)$)**: a function that takes in the current state of the agent, $s$, and return an action, $a$ to perform. The agent makes decision based on a policy. The goal of RL is to find an optimal policy $\\pi^*$ that maximizes expected return from every state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trajectory**: the sequence of states, actions, and rewards the agent experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Episode**: a trajectory that ends in a terminal state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration**: the agent tries new or less-known actions to discover the environment\n",

    "For a general RL workflow, the agent observes the current state of the environment and selects an action based on a policy at each time step. The environment then responds by transitioning to a new state and providing a reward that reflects the quality of the action taken. The agent uses this reward, along with the new state, to update its understanding of the environment and improve its policy\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle of observing, acting, receiving rewards, and learning continues over many episodes (trial and error), allowing the agent to gradually learn a policy that maximizes long-term cumulative reward. Key components of this process include exploration (trying new actions to gather information) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action to maximize reward). Over time, the agent aims to find a balance between the two and converge toward an optimal behaviour\n",

An agent will choose between $k$ different actions at each timestep, and recieves a reward based on the action chosen, but the reward distributions are unknown and different for each action. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative rewards in the given amount of steps\n",

    "\n",
    "The value of an action, $q(a)$, is the expected reward received when action $a$ is taken:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sample-Average Method\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the true action values $q(a)$ are unknown and must be estimated through repeated interactions with the environment.  \n",
    "One simple estimation approach is the sample-average method, where the estimated value $\\hat{q}_t(a)$ at time $t$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{q}_t(a) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \\mathbb{1}[A_i = a] \\cdot r_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \\mathbb{1}[A_i = a]} = \\frac{\\text{Cumulative reward recieved from action $a$ before timestep $t$}}{\\text{Total number of time the action $a$ is taken before timestep $t$}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "As the number of samples increases, $\\hat{q}_t(a)$ converges to the true expected value $q(a)$, by the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incremental Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning to estimate the expected reward of each action, we need to update our estimate each time a new reward is observed. One issue with the sample-average method is that it requires storing all past rewards for each action to compute $\\hat{q}_t(a)$. As the number of trials increases, the required memory grows linearly, which becomes inefficient. To solve this, we can rewrite the sample-average update in a recursive (incremental) form, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{q}_{t+1} = \\hat{q}_t + \\alpha_t \\left(r_t - \\hat{q}_t\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\hat{q}_{t+1}$: the updated estimate of the action-value after time step $t$\n",
    "* $\\hat{q}_t$: the previous estimate before seeing the latest reward\n",
    "* $r_t$: the reward received at time step $t$\n",
    "* $\\alpha_t$: the step size or learning rate, a value between 0 and 1 that determines how much the estimate is updated\n",
    "\n",
    "This form only requires storing the current estimate and does not require keeping track of all past rewards, making it computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Stationary Problem\n",
    "A problem is said to be stationary if the reward distribution for each action remains the same over time. However, in many real world RL problems, the environment is non-stationary, meaning the reward distributions change over time. In such cases, an agent must be able to adapt its action-value estimates to reflect the most recent outcomes more than older ones. The incremental update rule can be written in a recursive form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{q}_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)^t\\hat{q}_1 + \\sum^{t}_{i=1}\\alpha_t (1-\\alpha)^{t-i} r_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\alpha$: a constant step size between 0 and 1\n",
    "* $r_i$: the reward recieved after taking the action at timestep $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula represents the exponentially decaying weighted average of past rewards, where recent rewards are given more significance, and older rewards gradually “fade out” due to the $(1 - \\alpha)^{t-i}$ decay factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploration and Exploitation Tradeoff\n",
    "One key challenge in reinforcement learning is deciding when to explore and when to exploit, as an agent cannot do both simultaneously. Exploration helps the agent improve its knowledge about the environment, which can lead to greater rewards in the long term. Exploitation, on the other hand, involves leveraging the agent’s current knowledge to maximize immediate rewards. An optimal policy should strike a balance between exploration and exploitation based on the agent’s current knowledge and state, in order to maximize cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy\n",
    "The greedy policy is simple as the agent always exploits by choosing the action with the highest estimated reward, without any exploration. While this strategy can work in very simple or well-understood environments, it often performs poorly in more complex or uncertain problems, because the agent never tries new actions and thus fails to discover potentially better options or adapt when conditions change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\epsilon$ Greedy\n",
    "The $\\epsilon$-greedy policy is a variation of the greedy policy that introduces a small amount of exploration.  \n",
    "At each time step, the agent exploits with probability $1 - \\epsilon$, and explores by choosing a random action) with probability $\\epsilon$. This policy helps the agent avoid getting stuck with suboptimal actions by occasionally trying alternatives.This can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_t =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\arg\\max_a \\hat{q}_t(a) & \\text{with probability } 1 - \\varepsilon \\\\\n",
    "\\text{a random action} & \\text{with probability } \\varepsilon\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the $\\epsilon$ greedy policy will perform better than greedy in the long run as it gains more knowledge about the environment through exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimistic Initial Value\n",
    "Optimistic initial value is another strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by encouraging the agent to explore early. The idea is to initialize the estimated value of all actions to a number higher than the actual maximum reward. This causes the agent to optimistically assume all actions are promising, so it will try each action early on to verify its assumption. In the early timesteps, the agent explores all actions because it believes \"every action might be great.\" Over time, as the agent gathers more data and updates its estimates, the action values converge to their true values, and the agent naturally shifts to exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here are some issues of optimistic initial value:\n",
    "1. Only encourages early exploration: Once the agent’s estimates stabilize, it behaves greedily and stops exploring, which can lead to suboptimal policies if early exploration missed better actions\n",
    "2. Poor performance in non-stationary environments: In environments where the reward distributions change over time, the agent may stop exploring too early and fail to adapt\n",
    "3. Choosing the initial optimistic value is tricky: It must be high enough to encourage exploration, but not too high to delay convergence. Often, the true maximum reward is unknown, making this hard to tune\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper-Confidence Bound Action Selection (UCB)\n",
    "\n",
    "UCB is a method for balancing exploration and exploitation by considering both the current value estimates and the uncertainty in those estimates. At each time step, the agent selects the action using the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_t = \\arg\\max_a \\left[ \\hat{q}_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}} \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A_t$: the action selected at time step $t$\n",
    "* $\\hat{q}_t(a)$: the current estimated value of action $a$\n",
    "* $c$: a user-defined parameter that controls the degree of exploration. Larger $c$ encourages exploration; smaller $c$ favors exploitation\n",
    "* $t$: the current time step\n",
    "* $N_t(a)$: the number of times action $a$ has been selected so far\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, $\\hat{q}_t(a)$ is the exploitation term, which indicates the agent's current estimate of how good action $a$ is. The term $c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}}$ is the exploration bonus, which is large when action $a$ has been selected only a few times (low $N_t(a)$), encouraging the agent to explore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithmic (unbounded) growth in $\\ln t$ ensures that all actions will eventually be explored, but actions with lower estimated value or that have already been selected many times will be chosen less frequently over time. This way, UCB systematically prioritizes actions with high upper confidence bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: UCB is an deterministic algorithm\n",

    "# Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n",
    "In the bandit problem, the agent selects actions in the same static environment, where each action yields a reward independent of past actions or time. However, in many real-world problems, the environment is dynamic, and the agent must select different actions depending on the current situation. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a classical formalization for sequential decision making tasks, where each action affects not only the immediate reward but also the next state and all future actions and rewards as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All MDPs are Markovian, meaning the future state and reward depend only on the current state and action, not on the full history. Therefore, knowing the current state is sufficient for optimal decision making, and remembering earlier states does not improve predictions about the future.\n",

    "## The Agent-Environment Interface\n",
    "In MDPs, the agent and environment interact continuously in either discrete or continuous time. At each timestep $t$, the agent selects an action $A_t$ based on the current state of the environment $S_t$. As the result of its action, the agent will recieve a reward $r_t$ from the envirnment at the next timestep $t+1$, and the environment will transition into a new state $S_{t+1}$.

After an episode ends, the environment resets, and the next episode begins independently of how the previous one ended.\n",

    "Generalized Policy Iteration  refers to the framework in reinforcement learning where policy evaluation and policy improvement are interact repeatedly and approximately to gradually refine a policy toward optimality. The key idea is that evaluation and improvement do not need to fully complete before the next begins. As long as policy evaluation moves the value function closer to accurate estimates under the current policy, and policy improvement makes the policy greedier with respect to those estimates, the process will converge over time. If both the value function and the policy eventually stabilize, meaning no further updates occur, then the policy must be optimal, and the value function must be the optimal value function.\n",

    "There are two types of DP methods, synchronous and asynchronous DP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synchronous DP: the value of all states is updated simultaneously and systematically in each iteration based on the values from the previous iteration. This is conceptually simple and easy to parallelize, but can be inefficient if many states are rarely visited or irrelevant in a given policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asynchronous DP: only a subset of states is updated at a time. This allows for more targeted updates focusing on states that are frequently visited or have recently changed. Asynchronous methods can often reach good solutions more quickly in practice. However, to guarantee convergence to the correct value function, all states must still be updated sufficiently often over time. This means asynchronous DP does not necessarily reduce the total number of updates needed for convergence, but it allows for smarter scheduling and prioritization of updates. In practice, this leads to more efficient use of computational resources, especially when combined with techniques like prioritized sweeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of DP\n",
    "However, \"efficiency\" of DP in a theoretical sense does not always translate to practicality in real world problems because of the following reasons\n",

In real world problems, this dynamic model is usually unknown, making pure DP methods inapplicable without approximation or learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "# On-Policy vs Off-Policy Learning\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, there are two fundamental paradigms for learning from interaction, on-policy and off-policy learning. The key difference lies in whether the policy being learned is the same as the policy used to generate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On-Policy Learning\n",
    "In on-policy learning, the agent learns about and improves the same policy that it uses to make decisions. This means the data used for learning is generated by following the current policy, which typically includes a balance of exploitation and exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "1. Conceptually simpler.\n",
    "2. Lower variance in value estimates since learning is based on the actual policy being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Exploration is constrained by the policy itself.\n",
    "2. May learn slower due to limited exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-Policy Learning\n",
    "In off-policy learning, the agent learns about a different policy than the one used to generate the data. There are two distinct policies involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Target policy: the policy the agent is trying to learn or evaluate, denoted by $\\pi(a \\mid s)$\n",
    "2. Behaviour policy: the policy used to generate data (select actions), denoted by $b(a \\mid s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the agent to learn an optimal or deterministic target policy while still exploring using a stochastic behaviour policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "1. More general and powerful; can learn from data generated by other agents or past experiences.\n",
    "2. Enables stronger exploration while still converging to an optimal deterministic policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Higher variance in updates, especially when using importance sampling.\n",
    "2. Requires careful alignment between behaviour and target policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For off-policy learning to be valid, the behaviour policy must cover all the actions that the target policy might take. That is:\n",
    "$$\\text{If } \\pi(a \\mid s) > 0, \\text{ then } b(a \\mid s) > 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the agent gets enough data to estimate the value of the target policy correctly. If the behaviour policy never explores certain actions that the target policy might select, it is impossible to evaluate or improve the target policy accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance Sampling\n",
    "Importance sampling is a fundamental technique used in off-policy reinforcement learning. It allows us to estimate expectations under one probability distribution (the target policy) using samples drawn from a different distribution (the behaviour policy). This is crucial in off-policy learning, where the agent aims to learn or evaluate a policy that is different from the one used to generate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In off-policy learning, we want to compute the expected return or value function under the target policy $\\pi$, but the agent collects data using the behaviour policy $b$, which is, generally, a more exploratory policy. Since the distrubtion of the target and behaviour policies are different, we need a way to \"correct\" for the difference in distributions, which is importance sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematics\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ is the importance sampling ratio, which reweights the samples to reflect their importance under the target distribution. The importance sampling ratio reflects the ratio between the two distributions, which allows us to estimate expectations under one distribution using samples from another by accounting for the difference in likelihood between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance Sampling in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "In the context of RL, the goal is to estimate the expected return under a target policy $\\pi$, but the data (state-action-reward trajectories) was generated by a different behaviour policy $b$. Even if the actions taken differ, both the target policy $\\pi$ and the behaviour policy $b$ interact with the same environment. This means the state transition dynamics are the same for both, since they are governed by the MDP and do not depend on the policy itself. As a result, the only difference between trajectories generated by $b$ and those from $\\pi$ lies in how actions are selected at each state, which is the difference in the distributions of the policies. By accounting for this difference with importance sampling, we can accurately estimate the expected return of the target policy $\\pi$ using samples generated by the behaviour policy $b$.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\rho_t = \\frac{\\pi(a_t \\mid s_t)}{b(a_t \\mid s_t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ratio tells us how to reweight a sample from the behaviour policy $b$ to estimate its expected contribution under the target policy $\\pi$. In other words, it represents the ratio of the likelihood of taking the same action $a$ in the same state $s$ between the two policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $\\rho_t$ is small, it means this action was much more likely under $b$ than under $\\pi$, so this sample is less relevant to what $\\pi$ would do. We downweight it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially, $\\rho_t$ tells us how much a sample from $b$ should count when estimating what $\\pi$ would do. It adjusts for the differences of the distributions between the two policies, so that we can use data from one policy to estimate the behaviour of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the return under the target policy $\\pi$ over a full trajectory of length $T$, we compute the cumulative importance sampling ratio from time $t$ onward, where\n",

Instead, we learn the action-value function $q(s, a)$, which estimates the expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$ and then following the policy. This allows us to both evaluate and improve the policy directly. We will address 3 different TD control algorithms: SARSA, Q-learning, and expected SARSA\n",

This allows the agent to quickly recognize that a policy leading to such traps is poor and adjust its behavior before the episode is over.\n",

    "## Q-Learning\n",
    "Q-learning is an off-policy TD control algorithm that directly learns the optimal action-value function $q_*$, rather than the action-value function of the current policy $q_\\pi$. This differs from SARSA (on-policy), which learns $q_\\pi$ for the policy being followed. The Q-learning update rule is\n",

    "\n",
    "Both SARSA and Q-learning are sample-based solutions to the Bellman equations and can converge to the true action-value functions given enough samples. However there's a key difference in which Bellman equation the algorithm is solving\n",
    "\n",
    "- SARSA solves the Bellman expectation equation for $q_\\pi$, where\n",
    "  $$q_\\pi(s, a) = \\sum_{s'} \\sum_{r} p(s', r \\mid s, a) \\left[ r + \\gamma \\sum_{a'} \\pi(a' \\mid s') q_\\pi(s', a') \\right]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, SARSA need to follow policy iteration by first estimate $q_\\pi$ from experience, then make the policy greedy (or $\\epsilon$-greedy) with respect to $q_\\pi$. On the other hand, Q-learning effectively uses value iteration. It updates $q(s,a)$ as if it were already the optimal $q_*$, combining policy evaluation and improvement in a single step during the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm because it always learns from the value of the best possible action it could take in the next state, rather than the value of the action it actually took. In this case, the target policy (the policy Q-learning is trying to learn) is always greedy with respect to the current action-value estimates, which is not needed during learning because we only aim to get the optimal action-value function, $q_*$. Once $q_*$ is obtained, we can directly extract the optimal policy from it by acting greedily with respect to $q_*$. The behaviour policy (the policy used to select actions during learning) can be any exploratory policy, such as $\\epsilon$-greedy or even random, as long as it ensures sufficient exploration. This separation between the behavior policy and the target policy is what makes Q-learning off-policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, it does not require importance sampling to reweight trajectories. Importance sampling is typically used to correct for differences in action-selection probabilities between the target policy and the behavior policy. However, Q-learning’s update rule always evaluates the next state using the greedy action with respect to the current action-value estimates, regardless of the action actually taken by the behavior policy. Because the target in the update is determined solely by the current Q-values and not by the behavior policy’s action probabilities, no such correction is needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike SARSA, which updates its estimates using a single sampled action from the next state, Expected SARSA computes a weighted average over all possible actions in the next state, weighted by the policy's action probabilities. This reduces variance in the estimation process because SARSA's reliance on a single sample can lead to high variability, as the update depends heavily on whether the sampled action is favorable or not. In contrast, Expected SARSA’s use of the expected value produces a deterministic and more stable update, often allowing for larger step sizes ($\\alpha$) without destabilizing learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that SARSA’s updates are influenced by the randomness of a single action choice, which can make large-step-size update overly aggressive and prone to divergence. Expected SARSA, on the other hand, bases its update on the expected return under the policy, smoothing out randomness across all possible actions. As learning progresses and the action-value estimates converge, the computed expected value approaches the current estimate, where $\\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\mid S_{t+1}) \\, q(S_{t+1}, a) \\approx q(S_t, A_t)$, meaning the update term goes to zero and learning stabilizes after enought training.\n",

    "Expected SARSA can function as both an on-policy and off-policy algorithm, depending on how actions are selected during learning. The key to this flexibility lies in its update rule, which computes the expected action-value over all possible next actions, weighted by the policy $\\pi(a \\mid S_{t+1})$. This update computation is independent of the actual action taken, meaning expected SARSA can function as both an on-policy and off-policy algorithm\n",

This makes Q-learning inherently off-policy, as it learns the optimal policy while potentially following an exploratory policy, making it an special case of Expected SARSA\n",

    "# Models In Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, a model stores knowledge about the environment dynamics, which tells the agent how the environment responds to actions by producing rewards and transitioning to new states. In other words, the model tells the agent how the world works based on its current understanding. By using this knowledge, the model can be used to simulate the environment and produce simulated experience for the agent to learn from. There are two types of models\n",
    "1. Sample models: return a single possible outcome by sampling from the underlying probability distribution of state transitions and rewards.\n",
    "    - Pros: Fast, memory-efficient.\n",
    "    - Cons: Less accurate, as each sample is only an approximation of the full distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Distribution models: specify the complete probability distribution over all possible outcomes.\n",
    "    - Pros: More accurate and informative.\n",
    "    - Cons: Larger, more computationally expensive.\n",
    "    - Note: A distribution model can also be used to generate a sample model by sampling from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, there are two types of learning methods, model-based and model-free methods. Model-based methods. Model-based methods rely heavily on planning—using the model to simulate possible futures, evaluate them, and improve the policy before acting in the real environment, like DP, which looks ahead for the future rewards before selecting an action. Model-free methods, on the other hand, do not learn or estimate the model and learn the value function directly from experience through trial and error, like MC or TD methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For learning to happen, the agent must interact with an environment, which itself follows some transition and reward dynamics (this is the “true model” of the world). The key difference between model-based and model-free methods lies in whether the learning algorithm explicitly learns or uses its own approximation of this model. Both approaches aim to improve estimates of value functions (and ultimately the policy), but model-based methods do so by first estimating the transition and reward functions and then planning with them, whereas model-free methods skip this step and learn value functions directly from experience without building an explicit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any reinforcement learning setup, there is always one model that truly exists, which is the environment’s real rules. This is the true model of the world, whether it’s physics in the real world or the programmed logic in a simulator. The difference between model-based and model-free methods is about whether the agent also builds a second model of its own:\n",

    "Random tabular Q-planning is a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Instead of interacting with the real environment, it uses a learned or known model of the environment to simulate experiences and update the action-value function.

    "## Dyna-Q\n",
    "Dyna-Q is an architecture that allows the agent to perform online planning by integrating learning, planning, and acting into a single unified process, allowing the agent to interact with the real environment while simultaneously planning for future steps. In online planning, each real experience is used in two ways:\n",
    "1. Direct Reinforcement Learning (Direct RL): The agent immediately updates its value function and improve the policy using the real experience.\n",
    "2. Model Learning: The agent uses the real experience to improve its internal model of the environment’s dynamics, making it more accurately match the real world for planning purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining a model through model learning, the agent can generate simulated experiences to improve the policy without further real-world interaction. This makes fuller use of limited data, enabling better performance with fewer environmental interactions. On the other hand, direct RL is simpler and free from biases that may arise from an imperfect model since it updates only from actual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:554/1*j5chypwunyX00ejvuu10Gw.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dyna-Q runs the following processes continuously and in parallel:\n",
    "1. Planning through simulated experiences generated by the model\n",
    "2. Acting by interacting with the environment  \n",
    "3. Model learning by updating the internal model from real experiences\n",
    "4. Direct RL through updating the value function from real experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "For direct RL, Dyna-Q uses one-step tabular Q-learning like before, where\n",
    "$$q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a q(S_{t+1}, a) - q(S_t, A_t) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For planning, Dyna-Q uses random-sample one-step tabular Q-planning, which consists of:\n",
    "1. Search Control: Randomly select a state–action pair from those the agent has previously experienced. If the agent has never visited a state–action pair, it cannot plan from it because no outcome information is available.\n",
    "2. Model Query: Feed the selected state–action pair into the model, which returns a simulated reward and next state. In the basic Dyna-Q formulation, the model is assumed deterministic, meaning it returns the same result for a given state–action pair as last observed.\n",
    "3. Value Update: Apply the same Q-learning update rule as in direct RL, but using the simulated transition as if it were real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Each Q-planning step simulates and updates only one state–action pair (a single one-step transition) at a time. However, Q-planning is performed many times in succession after every real Q-learning update, meaning the agent will plan for multiple times before it takes every action in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Q-learning (direct RL) and Q-planning share and update the same action-value function. The difference lies in the source of the experience, where direct RL updates are based on real interactions with the environment and Q-planning updates are based on simulated interactions using the agent’s learned model. In this sense, Q-planning is essentially Q-learning in simulation, meaning Dyna-Q does not reduce the computational effort per update (it actually adds a bit more computation) since planning requires querying and simulating with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Dyna-Q greatly improves sample efficiency. By reusing real experiences through the model, the agent can perform many extra updates in simulation without needing to gather new real-world data. This allows it to learn a good policy with fewer real episodes, which is especially valuable when real interactions are costly or limited.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One limitation of Dyna-Q is its inefficiency in the early stages of learning. When the agent has very limited or no data, most planning steps are not meaningful because the model has little information to simulate with. As a result, many of the early updates contribute little to improving the policy. However, once the agent begins to collect real experiences, planning can replay these experiences in simulation, compounding their value and allowing the agent to improve with far fewer real interactions. This makes Dyna-Q particularly powerful in later phases of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation lies in the search control step. In Dyna-Q, state–action pairs are sampled at random for planning, which can be inefficient, especially when the state–action space is very large. Many updates may focus on unimportant or rarely visited states, leading to wasted computation. In such cases, a large number of planning steps is required before the updates significantly impact performance.\n",

    "## Wrong Models\n",
    "Planning in model-based RL depends entirely on the agent’s internal model of the environment. However, this model can often be wrong, meaning the stored transitions differ from what actually happens in the real environment. There are two main ways a model can be wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incomplete Model: The agent has not yet experienced certain state–action pairs, so their outcomes are simply missing from the model. This typically happens in the early stages of learning, when exploration is still limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inaccurate Model: The transitions stored in the model no longer match the environment’s true dynamics. This occurs most often when the environment is non-stationary (changing over time). In this case, planning may actually harm learning: the agent updates its value function based on outdated or incorrect information, pushing the policy in the wrong direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Wrong Models\n",
    "1. Dealing with Incomplete Models: This can be easily solved by using an exploratory policy. With enough experience, the agent will eventually visit all state–action pairs, filling in the missing parts of the model and making it complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dealing with Inaccurate Models: This requires continuous exploration to ensure the model stays up to date. If the environment changes, the only way to correct the model is to revisit those states and actions. A common strategy is **Dyna-Q+**, an algorithm that adds an exploration bonus to the reward to encourage the agent to revisit states that have not been seen for a long time in real life, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = r + \\kappa \\sqrt{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $r$: the original reward \n",
    "* $\\kappa$: a small positive constant (bonus weight)  \n",
    "* $\\tau$: the number of time steps since the state was last visited\n",
    "* $\\sqrt{\\tau}$: a bonus, artificial reward to encourage exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The artificial reward (exploration bonus) is used only within the agent’s internal model, not in the real environment. It grows over time for states that have been neglected to encourage the agent to revisit less-frequented states. Initially, this would update the action-value function in the wrong direction during planning since the bonus reward doesn’t actually exist in the real environment. But this distortion is intentional because during planning, the action-value function is biased upward for underexplored states. This makes those states look more attractive, encouraging the agent to select them in real interactions. Then, once the agent visits the state in real experience, it receives the true reward from the environment. The action-value function is updated again, correcting any bias introduced by the artificial bonus. In the long run, this process ensures that the value function converges to reflect the true environment dynamics, while the exploration bonus serves only as a temporary motivator. The result is a policy that balances exploration and exploitation, maintaining accuracy while improving sample efficiency."

    "# Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation\n",
    "So far, all the methods we have discussed rely on tabular representations, where each state or state–action pair has its own entry in a table storing its value. This works for small problems but becomes completely impractical when the state or action space grows large or infinite. In such cases, storing a value for every possible state or state–action pair would require infinite memory and computation, making tabular methods infeasible. To address this, we shift to function approximation. Instead of maintaining an explicit table, we use a parameterized function to approximate the value function. This allows us to represent an enormous set of states using a finite set of parameters. The goal is to find an approximation that is “good enough” given limited data, memory, and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function approximation reframes value estimation as a supervised learning problem: given a state or state–action pair, the function predicts its value, and the agent updates this function based on observed returns. This introduces the concept of generalization: leveraging patterns learned from past experiences to predict values for unseen states. Generalization significantly improves sample efficiency and scalability because the agent doesn’t need to experience every state individually. Instead, it can make informed decisions in unfamiliar states based on what it has learned from similar ones, enabling RL to work in complex, real-world environments where tabular methods are infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to generalization, which enables an agent to apply knowledge from similar states to new situations, discrimination is about deciding when two situations are not similar enough to share the same knowledge. Discrimination ensures that the agent treats states appropriately when they differ in ways that matter for decision-making. For example, tabular methods are an extreme case of perfect discrimination, where each state is treated as entirely unique and independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both extremes can lead to problems:\n",
    "* Over-generalization occurs when the agent assumes that states are more similar than they actually are, leading to poor approximations and oversimplified decision-making.\n",
    "* Over-discrimination happens when the agent treats even very similar states as completely different, which dramatically increases memory and computation requirements and slows learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In function approximation, the key is to find a balance between generalization and discrimination. The agent must know when to leverage previously learned information and when to treat new situations independently, ensuring efficient learning without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On-Policy Prediction with Approximation\n",
    "On-policy prediction with approximation means we learn a parameterized function, $\\hat{v}(s; w)$, that estimates the true state-value function $v_{\\pi}(s)$, such that $\\hat{v}(s; w) \\approx v_{\\pi}(s)$. In the parametrized function, $s$ is the current state and $w$ is the weight vector of the function. The parameterized function, $\\hat v$, can be a linear function, a non-linear function, or even a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike tabular methods, where each state has its own entry, function approximation uses a finite set of weights to represent a potentially infinite number of states. Typically, the number of weights is much smaller than the total number of states. This has two major implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generalization: Updating one weight affects many states at once because the same parameters influence multiple predictions.\n",
    "* Scalability: The method can handle large or continuous state spaces, where storing values for every state would be infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows reinforcement learning to move beyond small, discrete environments and operate effectively in complex real-world settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Approximation as Supervised Learning\n",
    "Function approximation in reinforcement learning can be viewed as a supervised learning problem where the input is a state $s$ and the output is the predicted value of that state, $v_{\\pi}(s)$. The goal is to make these predictions as close as possible to the true returns under policy $\\pi$. However, applying supervised learning methods directly in RL is not straightforward because RL presents unique challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional supervised learning, which relies on a fixed dataset, reinforcement learning is an ongoing process that requires online learning, the ability to adapt continually as new experiences arrive. Furthermore, methods like TD learning and DP introduce additional complexity through bootstrapping, where the algorithm uses its current value estimates to predict future returns. This creates non-stationary targets because as the approximator updates, the targets themselves keep changing. Such instability can lead to divergence if the function approximation method is not designed to handle these conditions. These challenges highlight why not all function approximators are suitable for RL. Techniques must allow incremental updates, remain stable under bootstrapping, and cope with non-stationary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Objective: Mean Squared Value Error\n",
    "The prediction objective, denoted as $\\bar{VE}$, measures how close our approximated value function $\\hat{v}(s; w)$ is to the true value function $v_{\\pi}(s)$ by computing the mean squared value error. In function approximation, adjusting the weights to improve accuracy for one state often affects predictions for other states due to shared parameters. Therefore, the goal is to minimize this objective so that the approximation performs well across all states.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all states are equally important. Some states occur more frequently or have higher significance in decision-making. To account for this, we introduce a state distribution $\\mu(s)$, which represents the relative importance (or probability) of each state. The weighted prediction objective is then defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{VE} = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu(s) \\big( v_{\\pi}(s) - \\hat{v}(s; w) \\big)^2$$\n",

    "* $\\mu(s)$: A probability distribution over all possible states that indicates the importance or visitation frequency of each state $s$.\n",
    "* $v_{\\pi}(s)$: True value of state $s$ under policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "* $\\hat{v}(s; w)$: Approximate value produced by the parameterized function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing $\\bar{VE}$ ensures that the approximation prioritizes accuracy for frequently encountered or critical states, resulting in better performance under realistic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent for Value Function Approximation\n",

So, we should carefully select which method to use depend on the problem itself and the desired convergence\n",

    "This inequality guarantees that the asymptotic error of TD will be no more than $\\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma}$ times the minimal error. In practice, when $\\gamma$ is small (far from 1), the bound is tight, and TD performs close to optimal; when $\\gamma$ is near 1 (long-term planning problems), the bound becomes large, meaning TD could potentially be much worse than the Monte Carlo solution. Thus, while TD methods are often preferred due to their online learning capability and lower variance, there is a trade-off in asymptotic performance. In problems with very high discount factors, it is important to carefully consider whether Monte Carlo or TD is more appropriate for the desired level of convergence."

    "## Feature Construction for Function Approximation\n",
    "We use features to represent a state. The way we represent states through features is crucial for reinforcement learning, as it directly impacts training speed, stability, and the ability to incorporate prior domain knowledge. Good feature construction can enable an RL agent to generalize well, especially when dealing with large or continuous state spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear function approximation, each feature is treated independently, meaning the model cannot naturally capture interactions between features. To address this, we often engineer or combine features to create richer representations that capture these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Aggregation\n",
    "State aggregation is one of the simplest techniques for feature construction. It works by grouping similar states together and treating them as if they were the same single state. This drastically reduces the number of distinct states, which makes learning more computationally efficient and improves generalization in large or continuous state spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In state aggregation, the core idea is to partition the state space into non-overlapping groups or aggregated states. This means each original state is assigned to exactly one group, and no state can belong to multiple groups at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayexists02/my-study-note/image/typora/image/image-20200303011108051.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, aggregation must be done carefully because too coarse aggregation makes the agent overgeneralizes by treating very different states as identical, which can lead to poor performance. Too fine aggregation, on the other hand, makes the agent essentially treats every state as unique, losing the benefit of generalization and requiring much more data. The key is to find a balance between generalization and discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coarse Coding\n",
    "Coarse coding is a way to represent states using overlapping features, which allows for more flexible and powerful generalization compared to non-overlapping methods like state aggregation. In coarse coding, each feature represents a region of the state space, and multiple features can cover the same state. This means a single state may activate several features at once. When an update occurs, all active features are adjusted, which in turn affects all states that share those features. As a result, learning about one state immediately improves the value estimates of nearby states. This overlapping structure provides smoother generalization, where similar states are treated similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape and size of these overlapping regions determine how the agent generalizes across states and how well it can discriminate between them:\n",
    "* Small, distinct regions: Provide fine-grained discrimination, allowing the agent to distinguish small differences between states. Suitable for tasks requiring precise control or where small differences are critical.\n",
    "* Large, broad regions: Lead to stronger generalization, as many states share the same features. Useful when the environment is noisy or when learning must be fast with limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By tuning the size and shape of these overlapping features, we can control the trade-off between generalization and discrimination\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tile Coding\n",
    "Tile coding is a type of coarse coding technique that creates overlapping state representations to improve generalization. It works by applying state aggregation (tiling) multiple times, with each tiling slightly offset from the others. In each tiling, the state space is divided into non-overlapping tiles (like a grid). Therefore, a given state activates exactly one tile in each tiling, meaning multiple features are active for the same state across different tilings. When the agent updates its value estimate, all active tiles are updated, which simultaneously updates the estimates of nearby states that share those tiles. This structure allows the agent to generalize efficiently as updaing to one state propagate to neighboring states through overlapping tiles.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1226/1*itlhmnwLnEtUaalSsivUVA.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The size and direction of the offset between tilings directly affect the degree and direction of generalization. Small offsets provide finer discrimination between nearby states and allow the agent to distinguish subtle differences. While larger offsets promote stronger generalization by grouping states more broadly, which is useful in noisy or high-dimensional environments. Also, the directions of offsets between each tiling directly impact the generalization directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tile coding is especially practical for modern reinforcement learning systems because:\n",
    "1. It is computationally efficient as only a fixed, small number of features are active per state.\n",
    "2. It naturally supports incremental updates, making it ideal for online learning.\n",
    "3. Its simplicity makes it easier to debug and visualize compared to complex non-linear methods like neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks for Feature Representation\n",
    "Another way to represent features in reinforcement learning is by using a neural network. In this approach, we can directly feed raw state data into the network rather than relying on hand-crafted features. The network automatically learns feature representations implicitly through the process of backpropagation, discovering patterns and relationships within the data as it trains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning process is framed as a supervised learning problem, where:\n",
    "* Input: The raw state or its basic attributes.\n",
    "* Output: The predicted value for that state, such as $\\hat{v}(s; w)$.\n",
    "* Objective: Minimize the value error, so the network’s predictions get closer to the true expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to coarse coding or other manual feature engineering methods, the neural networks have the advantages of\n",
    "1. Capture complex, non-linear relationships that simpler methods cannot represent.\n",
    "2. Eliminate the need for manual feature construction, as the network itself discovers useful features during training.\n",
    "3. Suitable for unstructured and high-dimensional inputs, such as images or raw sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But neural network also has the disadvantages of\n",
    "1. Prone to unstable learning, especially in RL where training data is non-stationary and bootstrapped targets are used.\n",
    "2. The learned features are often uninterpretable, making it difficult to understand why certain decisions are made.\n",
    "3. Require careful tuning of hyperparameters and large amounts of data for effective learning."

To do this, we can stack multiple copies of the state feature vector, one for each possible action.

For example, we can use a one-hot vector or a learned action embedding to represent the action and concatenate it with the state features to form a compact representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works especially well with neural networks, which can handle non-linear relationships and automatically learn how state and action features interact. However, for linear function approximators, this approach is much weaker as a linear function cannot easily capture the complex patterns between state and action from a single concatenated vector. In such cases, stacking remains the more effective choice.\n",

    "## Systematic Exploration In Functional Approximation\n",
    "Systematic exploration is critical in functional approximation as it forces the agent to explore and therefore obtain a better knowledge of the full environment. One way of encouraging systematic exploration is through optimisic initialization, which is done by initializing all the estimated state-values or action values to be higher than the actual ones. Similar to the tabular case, this makes the agent optimistic about all the states or state-action pairs so it will explore them in the beginning and gradually update the estimation to it's true values. However, this is not as simple as the tabular case due to two issues.\n",
    "1. We can only intiailize our optimistic initial values by initializing the weights $w$ of the function approximator. However in if the function approximator is a complex, non-linear function, like a neural network. We cannot gaurenteen that we can initialize the weights so the predicted value is always optimistic for all possible inputs\n",
    "2. Function approximation uses generalization for faster learning, but it also causes problems for exploration because the agent can think optimistically for one states and visit it and updates its estimation based on the observed return and transitions. However, the nearby states' values will also be updated due to the generalization, and therefore their updated values may not be optimistic any more although the state itself is not yet visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\epsilon$-greedy is another way that enforces exploration since the agent is foreced to taken a random choice of action from time to time. $\\epsilon$-greedy works for all cases of function approximation because it only depends on the final estimated values from the function approximator and therefore not impacted by generalization. However, the issue with $\\epsilon$-greedy is that its exploration purely depends on randomness, which is not systematic.\n",

    "## Systematic Exploration in Function Approximation\n",
    "Systematic exploration is critical in reinforcement learning with function approximation because it ensures that the agent explores different parts of the environment instead of getting stuck in a small subset of states or actions. This broader exploration helps the agent build a more accurate understanding of the environment and improves the quality of the learned policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimistic Initialization\n",
    "One common way to encourage exploration is through optimistic initialization, where the initial value estimates for all states or state-action pairs are set higher than their true values. This makes the agent initially optimistic about every unexplored state or action, motivating it to try them out in the beginning. Over time, as the agent gathers real experience, these optimistic estimates are gradually corrected toward their true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While optimistic initialization works well in tabular methods, it becomes more challenging with function approximation due to two main issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weight Initialization Limitation: in function approximation, we don't directly store a separate value for each state or state-action pair. Instead, we initialize the weights $w$ of the function approximator. For simple linear models, we may be able to set weights so that initial predictions are optimistic. However, for complex, non-linear models like neural networks, there is no guarantee that initializing the weights will produce optimistic predictions across all possible states. This makes it hard to ensure consistent optimistic initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Impact of Generalization: function approximation relies on generalization, so updating the estimate for one state can also affect the values of nearby or similar states. For example, when the agent visits a state and updates its value based on the observed return, neighboring states may also have their values updated indirectly. This can cause the optimistic initial values of unvisited states to disappear prematurely, even though those states have never been explored. As a result, the agent might stop exploring too soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration\n",
    "An alternative approach is $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration since it does not depend on optimistic initialization or how the weights are set. It only relies on the final outputs of the function approximator, making it robust to generalization issues. However, the $\\epsilon$-greedy explorations is random, not systematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Average Reward\n",
    "Average reward is another way of formalizing a continuing task without using discounting, which stabilizes the return and focuses on long-term steady-state performance. Instead of reducing the value of future rewards with a discount factor $\\gamma$, we evaluate a policy based on the average reward per time step that the agent receives when following that policy indefinitely. The average reward of a policy $\\pi$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(\\pi) = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi(a|s) \\, \\mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} \\mid S_t = s, A_t = a]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu_{\\pi}(s)$ is the stationary distribution of states under policy $\\pi$, representing how frequently each state is visited in the long run. By weighting rewards using $\\mu_{\\pi}(s)$, states that are visited more often have greater influence on the average reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average reward of a policy, $r(\\pi)$ is a single scalar value. So, we can easily compares two policies by comparing their average reward, and the policy with the higher average reward is better. The optimal policy, $\\pi_*$, is then the one that maximizes the average reward\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_* = \\arg\\max_\\pi r(\\pi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no discounting, we redefine returns using the differential return, which measures the cumulative difference between observed rewards and the average reward\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\big( R_{t+k+1} - r(\\pi) \\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation focuses on relative improvements compared to the average reward rather than just raw accumulated reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the differential return, we can write the Bellman equations for the average reward setting. These equations are very similar to the discounted case but without the discount factor, and using the average reward term instead, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r \\mid s, a) \\big[ r - r(\\pi) + v_{\\pi}(s') \\big]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using Average Reward for Control\n",
    "The updates using average reward are very similar to those in the discounted case, with a key difference on how the update is computed. In standard Q-learning with discounting, the update rule is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the discount factor $\\gamma$ down-weights future rewards, emphasizing immediate rewards more strongly. In average reward methods, there is no discount factor $\\gamma$. Instead, we subtract the current estimate of the average reward $r(\\pi)$ of the policy at each step, where\n",

    "In addition to updating the action-value function, we must also update the estimate of the average reward after each state–action–reward pair.

    "# Policy Gradient Method\n",
    "So far, all the methods we have introduced are value-based learning methods. In these methods, the agent first learns value functions, such as the state-value function $v(s)$ or the action-value function $q(s, a)$ from experience. Then, the agent selects actions based on these value estimates, and the policy is indirectly derived from the learned value functions. In other words, the value functions act as a bridge between the agent’s current state and its decision-making policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning value functions and deriving a policy from them, we can directly learn the policy as a parameterized function and optimize it. This method is called the policy gradient method. We represent the policy by $\\pi(a \\mid s, \\theta)$, which gives the probability of selecting action a given state $s$ and parameters $\\theta$. Here, $\\theta$ represents the learnable parameters of the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\pi(a \\mid s, \\theta)$ to be a valid probability distribution, it must satisfy two constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-negativity: $\\pi(a \\mid s, \\theta) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}, , s \\in \\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normalization: $\\sum_a \\pi(a \\mid s, \\theta) = 1 \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These ensure that for every state, the probability of each action is non-negative and the total probability over all actions equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy these constraints, we first define a real-valued function called the action preference, denoted as $h(s, a, \\theta)$. The action preference represents how desirable it is to take action a in state s under parameters $\\theta$. Since $h(s, a, \\theta)$ can take any real value, we convert it into a valid probability distribution using the softmax function, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(a \\mid s, \\theta) = \\frac{e^{h(s, a, \\theta)}}{\\sum_{a’} e^{h(s, a’, \\theta)}}$$\n",

    "After the softmax function, the probability distribution for all actiosn under every states is now valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanages of Policy Gradient Method\n",
    "The optimal policy for a given problem can be deterministic or stochastic. In value-based methods, improving the policy usually involves making it greedy or $\\epsilon$-greedy with respect to the current action-value estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has two major limitations:\n",
    "1. Difficulty in Learning Stochastic Policies: in many problems, the optimal policy is stochastic, meaning the agent must randomize its actions to perform well (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors, exploration in partially observable environments). Value-based methods struggle here because they force a near-deterministic improvement step by greedily selecting the best action or occasionally exploring using $\\epsilon$-greedy. This makes it difficult for the agent to naturally converge to a well-calibrated stochastic policy, as the randomness is artificially imposed instead of being learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limitations of $\\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration: $\\epsilon$-greedy is used in both tabular and function approximation settings to ensure exploration. However, because exploration is purely random, the agent always explores, even when it has already learned the optimal behavior. This creates a performance ceiling, as the agent never fully transitions to optimal exploitation and continues to take suboptimal random actions occasionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradient methods directly parameterize and optimize the policy. This allows them to adapt naturally to the type of policy required. If the optimal policy is deterministic, the learned policy will gradually converge to a pure deterministic form without requiring artificial exploration like $\\epsilon$-greedy. If the optimal policy is stochastic, the method will self-adjust and discover the correct distribution of actions through experience. This flexibility makes policy gradient methods more expressive and often more suitable for complex or uncertain environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in some problems, the value function can be extremely complex, while the policy itself is simple. In such cases, directly learning the policy is more efficient and practical than learning a full value function and deriving the policy indirectly. However, this is problem-dependent as there are also situations where value-based methods are simpler and more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy Gradient Objective\n",
    "The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy that maximizes the agent’s cumulative rewards.
