    "# The Data Generation Problem\n",
    "Data comes in many modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. We denote a generic data sample by the mathematical object $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Space\n",
    "A data sample $x$ belongs to a known data space, denoted as $\\mathcal{X}$ (i.e., $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$). Essentially, the data space is defined as a high dimensional space that contains all possible value combinations of the raw data representation. However, not all points within this high-dimensional space represent valid or meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider a dataset of $5 \\times 5$ black & white images of digits. If each pixel can take a binary value $\\{0, 1\\}$, the data space is $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}^{5 \\times 5}$. This space contains $2^{25}$ possible combinations. However, the vast majority of these points look like random noise; only a tiny subset actually forms coherent, recognizable digits, which are what we considered as valid data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Distribution\n",
    "The data distribution, denoted as $p(x)$, describes the probability of observing a specific sample $x$ from the space $\\mathcal{X}$. This distribution is the key to differentiating meaningful data from noise in the data space\n",
    "* Valid/Meaningful samples are assigned high probability.\n",
    "* Invalid samples are assigned a probability near or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, $p(x)$ mathematically represents the hidden patterns and structure governing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "A dataset is a finite collection of samples $\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$ that have been drawn (sampled) from the underlying data distribution $p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data spaces are typically high-dimensional and mathematically intractable. It is impossible to capture or enumerate every point in the space because the volume is too vast. However, valid data usually occupies a very small, concentrated region within this vast space (often referred to as a \"manifold\"). By modeling the data distribution $p(x)$, we can focus purely on these high-probability regions and ignore the massive regions of the data space that contain invalid noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of Generation\n",
    "In generative modeling, the goal is to learn a target data distribution $p(x)$, either explicitly (learning the density function) or implicitly (learning a mechanism to generate samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to construct a model that, after observing a limited training dataset, learns to sample new, unique data points that look as if they were drawn from the original distribution $p(x)$, although the original distribution is unknown."

    "# Discriminative and Generative Models\n",
    "### Discriminative Models\n",
    "For supervised learning tasks with data $(x, y)$, a discriminative model learns to directly estimate the conditional probability $P(y|x)$. This approach learns a decision boundary between different data points, which is effectively a direct mapping from an input to an output. Because they focus solely on the boundary, discriminative models do not explicitly model the underlying distribution of the input data, meaning they simply learn how to separate classes to minimize the loss but do not understand what the data actually looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Models\n",
    "A generative model aims to learn the complete data distribution. For a dataset without labels, it learns the distribution $P(x)$, and for a labelled dataset, it learns the joint distribution $P(x, y)$. This is often understood through the factorization $P(x|y)P(y)$, meaning the model learns \"what the data looks like\" (the likelihood $P(x|y)$) given a specific label.\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding allows generative models to perform both types of tasks:\n",
    "* Generative Task: For a desired label $y$, the model can generate new synthetic features $x$ by sampling from $P(x|y)$.\n",
    "* Discriminative Task: To classify a new input $x$, the model uses Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probability $P(y|x) \\propto P(x|y)P(y)$, allowing it to determine the most likely label.\n",

In generative approach, the model learns the likelihood $P(x|y)$ (the data distribution per class) and the prior $P(y)$, then combines them using Bayes' rule to compute the posterior $P(y|x)$ for classification."

    "# Naive Bayes\n",
    "In the standard application of Bayes' rule, the likelihood term $P(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n | y)$ represents the joint probability of all features occurring together given the class. Computing this is difficult because features often have complex correlations (dependencies), requiring a massive amount of data to model accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Naive Bayes simplifies the model by introducing the assumption of conditional independence. This assumes that, *given the class label*, knowing the value of one feature provides no information about the value of any other feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption allows us to decompose the complex joint likelihood into a simple product of individual probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x|y) = P(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n | y) \\approx \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i | y)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: This is a strong, naive assumption because real-world features are rarely independent. However, despite this theoretical flaw, Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and often performs surprisingly well as a baseline classifier. While its probability estimates might be inaccurate due to the assumption, its classification decisions are often correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to classify a new sample where $x_1=a$ and $x_2=b$. To do this, we calculate the posterior probability for both classes and pick the highest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Setup the equation for Class 1 (Spam)**\n",
    "Using the Naive Bayes assumption, we expand the formula:\n",
    "$$P(y=1 | x_1=a, x_2=b) \\propto P(y=1) \\cdot P(x_1=a | y=1) \\cdot P(x_2=b | y=1)$$\n",

    "* $P(x_2=b | y=1)$: In Spam messages, how often does feature $x_2$ equal $b$? (Likelihood 2)\n",

    "* If Score(Spam) > Score(Not Spam), we classify the sample as Spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinction lies in how we treat the features $x_1$ and $x_2$. Without the Naive assumption, we must treat the features as a coupled pair $(x_1, x_2)$. To calculate the likelihood $P(x_1=a, x_2=b | y)$, we would need to count how often the exact combination **\"a AND b\"** appears together in the training data. However, if the specific pair $(a, b)$ never appeared in the training set (sparsity), the probability becomes 0, and the model fails to make a prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "The intuition behind MLE is built on two observations:\n",
    "1.  **Sparsity of Observations:** Out of all possible configurations in the high-dimensional space, our collected samples $\\mathcal{D}$ represent the \"realized\" events. Because these specific points were observed, they must have a high density under the true probability distribution $P_{data}$.\n",
    "2.  **The Optimization Goal:** We want our model $P_{\\theta}$ to mimic this true distribution. We achieve this by adjusting the parameters $\\theta$ so that the model \"shifts\" its probability mass away from the \"empty\" noise regions and concentrates it on the specific coordinates of our observed samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset of cat images, the model should learn that a specific arrangement of pixels forming a \"cat\" is highly probable, while a random arrangement of \"static\" noise, despite being in the same high-dimensional pixel space, has a probability near zero.\n",
